# vault-guard – Decentralized Savings dApp

vault-guard is a decentralized savings application that allows users to deposit ETH into an on-chain time-locked vault, lock it for a defined period, and withdraw only after the lock has expired. This repository currently hosts the **React + Vite** frontend, which is designed to connect to a `Vault` smart contract (typically maintained in a separate Foundry repository) deployed on the Base network.

---

💡 **Key Features:**
- **Time-locked savings** with enforced lock periods
- **Wallet integration** via REOWN AppKit and WalletConnect v2
- **Real-time balance tracking** with countdown timers
- **Multi-network support** (Local, Base Sepolia, Base Mainnet)
- **Comprehensive diagnostics** for development and troubleshooting

## Overview

The vault-guard dApp is built to encourage disciplined savings by enforcing time-locked deposits on-chain.

Key capabilities:

- Connect an Ethereum wallet using **REOWN AppKit** with **WalletConnect v2**
- Deposit ETH into a personal time-locked vault contract
- Configure time-locked savings with enforced lock periods
- View real-time balance, lock status, and countdown timer
- Withdraw funds only after the configured unlock time has passed

> **Scope of this repository:** only the frontend lives here (in `frontend/`). The `Vault` smart contract itself should be managed in a dedicated Solidity/Foundry repository and deployed separately to Base testnet or mainnet.

## Project Structure

```text
.
├── frontend/                # React + Vite dApp (UI and wallet integration)
└── README.md                # Project-level documentation (this file)
```

- Frontend details (components, hooks, config, scripts) are documented in `frontend/README.md`.
- The `Vault` smart contract code is expected to live in a **separate** Solidity/Foundry repository (for example, `vault-guard-contracts`) and is **not** part of this repo.

### Quickstart (Frontend + Contracts)

Use this if you want to run both the contracts (in your own Foundry repo) and the frontend locally:

1. **Contracts (in your contracts repo):**

   ```bash
   forge install
   forge build
   forge test -vvv
   # deploy and copy the deployed Vault address
   ```

2. **Frontend (in this repo):**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # set VITE_REOWN_PROJECT_ID and VITE_VAULT_ADDRESS
   npm run dev
   ```

**🔧 For Complete Local Development Setup:**  
See the comprehensive [Local Development Setup Guide in CONTRACTS.md](./CONTRACTS.md#-local-development-setup) for detailed step-by-step instructions on:

- Setting up local blockchain with Anvil
- Deploying contracts locally
- Configuring frontend for local testing
- Environment switching between local/testnet/mainnet
- Troubleshooting common issues

Additional details on the expected contract interface live in [CONTRACTS.md](./CONTRACTS.md). UX copy and demo scripts are in [docs/](./docs/).

Add a link here to your contracts repository once it is available, for example:

## Frontend – Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js **v18+**
- npm (or another Node.js package manager)
- A REOWN Project ID (from [https://cloud.reown.com/](https://cloud.reown.com/))
- A WalletConnect-compatible Ethereum wallet (e.g. MetaMask)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example file and set the required values:

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and provide your configuration:

```env
VITE_REOWN_PROJECT_ID=your_reown_project_id_here
VITE_VAULT_ADDRESS=your_deployed_vault_contract_address_here
```

**Required Configuration:**

- `VITE_REOWN_PROJECT_ID` – Project ID from [REOWN Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/)
- `VITE_VAULT_ADDRESS` – Address of your deployed `Vault` smart contract

**🌐 Setting VITE_VAULT_ADDRESS by Environment:**

**For Local Development:**

1. **Local Network (Hardhat/Foundry/Anvil):**

   ```bash
   # Deploy your contract to local network
   forge create Vault --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
   # Copy the deployed address from output
   VITE_VAULT_ADDRESS=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
   ```

2. **Using Existing Testnet Contract:**
   ```bash
   # Use a shared testnet contract from your team
   VITE_VAULT_ADDRESS=0xabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcd
   ```

**For Base Sepolia Testnet:**

1. Deploy your Vault contract to Base Sepolia:
   ```bash
   # Deploy to Base Sepolia testnet
   forge create Vault --rpc-url $BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
   ```
2. Find your contract address:
   - Check deployment script output
   - Visit [Base Sepolia Explorer](https://sepolia.basescan.org/)
   - Search by transaction hash
3. Set the address:
   ```bash
   VITE_VAULT_ADDRESS=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
   ```

**For Base Mainnet (Production):**

1. Deploy your Vault contract to Base mainnet
2. Verify the contract on [BaseScan](https://basescan.org/)
3. Set the verified mainnet address:
   ```bash
   VITE_VAULT_ADDRESS=0xabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcd
   ```

**🔗 Finding Contract Addresses:**

- **Base Sepolia:** [https://sepolia.basescan.org/](https://sepolia.basescan.org/)
- **Base Mainnet:** [https://basescan.org/](https://basescan.org/)
- **Local:** Check your deployment script terminal output

**⚠️ Important Notes:**

- Testnet and mainnet addresses are **completely different** and NOT interchangeable
- The frontend will fail to load if this address is incorrect or missing
- Always use the correct address for your target network
- Contract verification on blockchain explorers is recommended for transparency
- Share testnet addresses with your development team for consistent testing

### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

By default, Vite serves the application at `http://localhost:3000` (or another available port as indicated in the terminal).

### 4. Build, Preview, and Lint

From the `frontend/` directory:

- Build for production:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- Preview the built app locally:

  ```bash
  npm run preview
  ```

- Lint the codebase:

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- Type-check the project:

  ```bash
  npm run type-check
  ```

### 🎯 Contract Address Sources

| Network          | How to Get Contract Address                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Local**        | Check deployment script output or use Anvil's default  |
| **Base Sepolia** | [Base Sepolia Explorer](https://sepolia.basescan.org/) |
| **Base Mainnet** | [BaseScan](https://basescan.org/)                      |

---

### ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Network-specific:** Contract addresses are network-specific and not interchangeable
- **Required for functionality:** `VITE_VAULT_ADDRESS` must be set correctly
- **Frontend will fail to load** if this address is incorrect or missing
- **Testnet vs Mainnet:** Never use testnet addresses on mainnet or vice versa

---

### 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Common issues:**

- **"Contract not deployed" error:** Check contract address and network
- **"Function not found" error:** Verify ABI matches deployed contract
- **Transaction fails:** Check account balance and network connection

**For detailed troubleshooting:** See [CONTRACTS.md](./CONTRACTS.md#troubleshooting-local-development)

---

### 🔗 Next Steps

After configuring the contract address:

1. **Start the development server:** `npm run dev`
2. **Connect your wallet** to the appropriate network
3. **Test the functionality** with deposits and withdrawals
4. **Verify contract interactions** work as expected

**For complete local development setup:** See [CONTRACTS.md#-local-development-setup](./CONTRACTS.md#-local-development-setup)

## Smart Contract (Conceptual Overview)

The actual `Vault` implementation should live in your contracts repository (for example, a Foundry project) and be deployed to Base Sepolia or Base mainnet. The frontend in this repo only **consumes** that contract via its address and ABI.

A typical `Vault` contract used with this dApp exposes the following behaviour:

- Stores the owner address.
- Stores a timestamp representing when funds can be withdrawn.
- Accepts ETH deposits while locked.
- Allows the owner to withdraw only after the unlock time.

An illustrative example contract might look as follows (for reference only):

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract Vault {
    address public owner;
    uint256 public unlockTime;

    constructor(uint256 _unlockTime) payable {
        owner = msg.sender;
        unlockTime = _unlockTime;
    }

    function deposit() external payable {}

    function withdraw() external {
        require(block.timestamp >= unlockTime, "Vault: Locked");
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Vault: Not owner");
        payable(owner).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }

    function getBalance() external view returns (uint256) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }
}
```

The canonical source of truth for the contract (files, tests, deployment scripts) should be your contracts repository. Use this section to link to it and briefly describe how the frontend and contracts are wired together (e.g. how the ABI and address are kept in sync).

---

## Testing and Quality

### Frontend

From the `frontend/` directory:

- Run linting:

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- Run TypeScript type checks:

  ```bash
  npm run type-check
  ```

### Smart Contracts (Foundry – Example)

If you manage the `Vault` smart contract with [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/), a typical workflow might look like:

```bash
forge install
forge build
forge test -vvv
```

Adapt these commands to match your actual contracts repository structure.

## CI/CD

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that:

- Runs on pull requests and pushes to `main`.
- Installs frontend dependencies, lints, type-checks, and builds the app.
- Optionally runs Foundry tests if `foundry.toml` exists in the repository.
- Provides an optional, manual `deploy` job via the "Run workflow" button.

### Triggers

- `pull_request`: Lint, type-check, and build run automatically for PRs.
- `push` to `main`: Same checks run on main.
- `workflow_dispatch`: Manual run; set input `deploy: true` to run optional deploy job.

### Optional deploy job secrets

Configure these repository secrets if you enable the deploy job (usually in your contracts repository):

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: Deployer private key (use a test key; never commit)
- `RPC_URL`: Network RPC endpoint (e.g., Base Sepolia)
- `EXPLORER_API_KEY`: Block explorer API key (optional, for verification if added)

Note: This repo hosts the frontend. Contract deployment/verification typically lives in the contracts repository where your Foundry project resides.
